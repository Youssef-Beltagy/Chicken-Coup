# Questions

This file is for documenting questions to the professor and their answers.

- How should we handle unimplemented addressing modes? Don't worry about them. We will not be tested for unrequired addressing modes.
- Should we stop disassembling when an op-code needs to access memory beyond the ending address? No, You can disassemble that op-code and exceed the ending address.
- How should we distinguish between ADD and ADDQ? They sometimes have identical signatures.
- Should we Implement ADDA?
- How do we load another program in memory? This is a simulator option.
- Is jmp always 3 words?
- For immediate EA and absolute EA, should we remove the left side zeros when printing or not?
- Is it okay that i have a line when I wait for the user to continue or not?





## Notes

- We can have subroutines in other files. Read the program requirements slides.
- Jump tables are explained in the addendum.
